## Definition

(technique used in object-oriented programming that simplifies the program's structure.)  
It focuses only on revealing the necessary details of a system and hiding irrelevant information to minimize its complexity.

> **In simpler terms, it means to show what an object does and hides how it does it.**

## Examples

There are countless examples that follow the rules of abstraction.

> Use of vehicles: to our general knowledge, the race peddle tells the car to consume fuel and increase its speed.  
> We do not need to understand the mechanical process.

## Implementation of abstraction in programming language

We can use functions to interact with the private data members. Users do not need know the implementation details of the functions. This is how we can achieve abstraction using classes.

## Advanteages of abstraction

The following are some advantages of abstraction:

- It reduces the complexity of the system from a user's perspective.
- It makes the code extendable and reusable.
- It refines the modularity of the application or the system.
- It makes the code more maintainable.

## Abstraction vs. encapsulation

Since abstraction and encapsulation are data hiding techniques of OOP, they are often confused with being the same.

Abstraction:

- focuses on the design level of the system.
- hides unnecessary data to simplify the structure.
- highlights the work that the object performs.
- abstraction means to hide implementation using interface and abstract classes.

Encapsulation:

- focuses on the application level of the system.
- restricts access to data to prevent its misuse.
- deals with the internal working of the object.
- encapsulation means to hide data using getter and setter functions.
