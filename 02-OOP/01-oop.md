## Definition

**Object-oriented programming**, also called OOP, is a programming model that is dependent on the concept of objects and classes.

OOP is a programming style, not a tool, so despite being old, it's vastly popular and established.

> This programming style **_involves dividing a program into pieces of objects_** that can communicate with each other. Every object has its own set of properties. These properties are later accessed and modified through the use of various operations.

## Building blocks of OOP

The following are the essential concepts of object-oriented programming:

- Attributes
- Methods
- Classes
- Objects

### Classes and objects

All objects have some state and behavior.

Where do objects come from?

- The answer is **Classes.** A class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating objects.

### Attributes

Attributes are **variables that represent the state of the object.**

### Methods

Methods are like functions that represent the behavior of the object.

Methods have access to class's attributes (and other methods). They can accept parameters, return values, and are used to perform an action on an object of a class.

## Principle of OOP

The following are four principles of object-oriented programming:

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
