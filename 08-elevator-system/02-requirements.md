# Requirements for the Elevator System

Learn about all requirements of the elevator system.

> We'll cover the following:
>
> - Requirement collection

Requirements define the scope of a problem, so getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

## Requirement collection

> - 1. There exist multiple elevator cars and floors in the building.
> - 2. Building can have a maximum of 15 floors and three elevators.
> - 3. The elevator car can move or down or be in an idle state.
> - 4. The elevator door can only be opened when it is in an idle state.
> - 5. Every elevator car passes through each floor.
> - 6. The panel outside the elevator should have buttons to call an elevator car and to specify whether the passenger wants to go up or down.
> - 7. The panel inside the elevator should have buttons to go to every floor.  
>      (There should be buttons to open or close the lift doors.)
> - 8. There should be a display inside and outside the elevator car to show the current floor number and direction of the elevator car.
> - 9. The display inside the elevator should also show the capacity of the elevator car.
> - 10. Each floor has a seperate panel and a display for each elevator car.
> - 11. Multiple passengers can go to the same or different floors in the same or opposite direction.
> - 12. The elevator system should be able to control the elevator car movement and door functioning and monitor the elevator car.
> - 13. The elevator control system should be able to send the most appropriate elevator to the passenger when the passenger calls the elevator car.
> - 14. The elevator car can carry a maximum of eight persons or 690 kilograms at once.
>
> We've identified our requirements for the problem.

> In the next lesson, we will define different use cases for the elevator control system.
