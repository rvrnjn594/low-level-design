UML diagrams can be classified into two categories:

- Structural UML diagrams
- Behavioral UML diagrams

> The following illustration represents the subcategories of structural and behavioral diagrams:

## Structural UML diagrams

Structural diagrams represent the static structure of the system. They never depict the system's dynamic behavior.

The most commonly used structural diagram in software development is the **class diagram.**

## Behavioral UML diagrams

Behavioral diagrams represent the dynamic behavior of elements in the system. All systems experience dynammic occurrences.

In object-oriented programming, we use behavioral diagrams to illustrate the dynammic behavioral semantics of a problem or its implementation.

The most commonly used behavioral diagrams are use **case diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams.**

## UML diagrams used in the OOD interview

In a typical OOD interview process, the following are the most widely asked UML diagrams:

- Use case diagram
- Class diagram
- Sequence diagram
- Activity diagram

> **NOTE:** The class diagram belongs to the structural diagrams and the use case, sequence, and activity diagrams belong to the behavioral diagrams category of the UML.

> The next few lessons will cover all the four UML diagrams above, in detail....
