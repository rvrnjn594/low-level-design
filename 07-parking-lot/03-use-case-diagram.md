Let's build the use case diagram of the parking lot system and understand the relationship between its different components.

> First, let's define the different elements of our parking lot, followed by the complete use case diagram of the system.

## System

Our system is a "parking lot."

## Actors

> Here are main actors of our parking lot system.
>
> #### Primary actors
>
> - **Customers:**  
>    This actor can park the vehicle in the allocated parking space according to the vehicle type and pay for the parking before exit.
