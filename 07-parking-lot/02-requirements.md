# Requirements for the Parking Lot Design

Learn about all requirements of the parking lot problem.

In this lesson, let's list down requirements of the parking lot system.

> This is a very crucial step since requirements define the scope of a problem, so getting them right from the interviewer and understanding them well will make the design of the rest of the system smooth and easy.

## Requirements collection

Let's define the requirements for the parking lot problem:

**R1**: The parking lot should have the **capacity to park 40,000 vehicles.**

**R2**: The four **different types of parking spots** are handicapped, compact, large, and motorcycle.

**R3**: The parking lot should have **multiple entrance and exit points.**

**R4**: Four **types of vehicles** should be allowed to park in the parking lot, which are _car, truck, van, and motorcycle._

**R5**: The parking lot should have a **display board that shows free parking spots** for each parking spot type.

**R6**: The system **should not allow more vehicles** in the parking lot if the maximum capacity (40,000) is reached.

**R7**: If the parking lot is completely occupied, the system should **show a message** on the entrance and on the parking lot display board.

**R8**: Customers should be **able to collect a parking ticket from the entrance and pay at the exit.**

**R9**: The customer **can pay for the ticket** either with an automated exit panel or pay the parking agent at the exit.

**R10**: The **payment should be calculated at an hourly rate.**

**R11**: **Payment can be made using either a credit/debit card or cash.**

> We've identified our requirements for the problem. Next, we will define different use cases of our parking lot system.
